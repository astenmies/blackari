# Blackari
ðŸ‘» A Go GraphQL server with a React SSR client (Next.js)

**The master branch can be used as is. Please note that this is currently a work in progress, expect changes.**

I advise to not use the next branch unless you would like to experiment or see where the project is going. The next branch sometimes contains broken code.

## Getting started

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/astenmies/blackari.git

# Change directory
cd blackari

# Rename .env.example to .env and fill it with your configs
cp client/.env.example client/.env
```
