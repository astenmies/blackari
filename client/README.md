yarn

# Run relay
yarn run relay

## Troubleshooting



### SyntaxError: Unexpected token import
This is almost always related to babel presets.
```bash
yarn add babel-preset-es2015 -D
```
Then add it in **.babelrc**. This is an example of a full minimal babel config file.
```
{
  "presets": [
    "es2015",
    "stage-1",
    "react"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "transform-object-assign"
  ]
}
